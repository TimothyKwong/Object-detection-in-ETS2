# Object Detection in ETS2

## Description
This code utilizes a pre-trained Faster-RCNN model from the [Pytorch library](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) for objection detection and the [Python-MSS library](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss) for window capture. The following gif illustrates the code detecting objects within [Euro Truck Simulator 2](https://eurotrucksimulator2.com/).
